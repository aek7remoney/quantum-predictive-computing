# Quantum Predictive Computing – by Zenith

This repository introduces a disruptive theoretical model of **quantum computation through teleportation and predictive entanglement orchestration**. The architecture is governed by a symbolic master equation capable of calculating, in advance, the optimal teleportation pathways between qubits in a dynamic mesh.

## Key Concepts

- Quantum teleportation as the primary mode of state propagation  
- Predictive routing across a topological qubit network  
- Entanglement directed by a “master equation” with system-wide perspective  
- Reduction of decoherence through intelligent qubit flow  
- Quantum mesh reconfiguration driven by purpose-based optimization

## Applications

- Quantum Artificial Intelligence  
- Fractal data compression  
- Cryptography with variable-state pathing  
- Multivariable system prediction  
- Conscious quantum system simulation
